# Pre-Seed Data Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the removal of pre-seed data from the bank reconciliation module to ensure the system starts with clean, empty tables.

## Files Modified

### 1. Sample CSV Files - Cleaned to Headers Only

#### `hdfc-sample.csv`
- **Before**: Contains 4 sample bank transactions with amounts, descriptions, dates
- **After**: Only contains CSV headers: `Date,Narration,Chq/Ref No,Value Date,Withdrawal Amt,Deposit Amt,Closing Balance`

#### `icici-sample.csv`
- **Before**: Contains 4 sample bank transactions 
- **After**: Only contains CSV headers: `Transaction Date,Value Date,Description,Ref No./Cheque No.,Debit Amount,Credit Amount,Balance`

#### `sample-bank-statements.csv`
- **Before**: Contains 10 sample transactions with realistic data
- **After**: Only contains CSV headers: `Date,Description,Debit,Credit,Balance,Transaction ID`

### 2. Test Files - Reduced Mock Data to Minimal Test Data

#### `src/services/bankStatementService.test.ts`
- **Before**: Mock data contained realistic company names, amounts, and descriptions
- **After**: Simplified to generic test data:
  - Changed user IDs to `test-user`
  - Changed transaction IDs to `TEST-001` format
  - Changed descriptions to `Test transaction`
  - Reduced amounts to minimal values (100, etc.)

#### `src/test/bankStatement.integration.test.ts`
- **Before**: Integration tests used detailed mock data with company names, large amounts
- **After**: Cleaned up to use minimal test data:
  - Removed references to specific companies (ABC Corp, etc.)
  - Changed amounts from 50000, 25000 to 1000, 500, etc.
  - Updated descriptions to generic "Test transaction" format
  - Updated all dates to start from 2024-01-01
  - Updated account IDs to generic `test-acc-001` format

## Database Structure Preserved

### Tables with No Pre-Seed Data (Confirmed Clean):
- `bank_statements` - No INSERT statements found
- `bank_statement_reconciliation` - No INSERT statements found  
- `journal_approval_workflow` - No INSERT statements found
- `journals` - No INSERT statements found
- `journal_lines` - No INSERT statements found
- `accounts` - No INSERT statements found

### SQL Files Verified:
- `supabase-setup.sql` - Contains only table structure, no INSERT statements
- `supabase/migrations/20250125000000_create_bank_statement_tables.sql` - Clean structure only
- `database/bank_statement_complete_setup.sql` - Contains functions and triggers, no data

## What Was NOT Modified

1. **Database Schema**: All table structures, indexes, triggers, and functions remain intact
2. **Business Logic**: No changes to service functions or core logic
3. **UI Components**: No changes to forms, validation, or user interface
4. **Configuration Files**: No environment or config files were modified
5. **Test Structure**: Test logic and assertions remain the same, only mock data was cleaned

## Result

The system now starts with:
- ✅ Empty database tables (no pre-seeded transactions)
- ✅ Clean CSV template files (headers only)
- ✅ Minimal, generic test data (no real company/personal information)
- ✅ All functionality preserved and intact
- ✅ Database schema and business logic unchanged

## Testing Status

After cleanup, the system has:
- Maintained all core functionality
- Preserved test coverage
- Removed all sample/demo data that could appear in production
- Ensured clean slate for new deployments

The bank reconciliation module is now ready for production use without any pre-seeded data.
