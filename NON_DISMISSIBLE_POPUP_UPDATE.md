# Non-Dismissible License Expiry Popup Update

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### 🚫 **Popup Cannot Be Bypassed**
- **Removed close button (X)** from the dialog
- **Disabled escape key** - pressing ESC won't close popup
- **Disabled outside clicks** - clicking outside popup won't close it
- **No onOpenChange handler** - dialog state cannot be changed externally

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

#### **Custom DialogContent Component**
- Created `DialogContentNoClose` component without the hardcoded close button
- Based on original DialogContent but removes the X button completely
- Maintains all other styling and functionality

#### **Event Prevention**
```tsx
<DialogContentNoClose 
  onPointerDownOutside={(e) => e.preventDefault()} 
  onEscapeKeyDown={(e) => e.preventDefault()}
>
```

#### **Dialog State Management**
- Removed `onOpenChange` prop from Dialog component
- Empty `onClose` function in LicenseExpiryManager
- Popup can only be dismissed by taking action (renew/extend)

### 🎯 **User Experience**

#### **For Users on Expiry Day:**
1. **Popup appears** - cannot be closed or bypassed
2. **Must choose action**:
   - Click "Activate License" → Opens pricing page
   - Click "Extend License" → Shows extension form
3. **Only way to continue** is to resolve the license issue

#### **No Escape Routes:**
- ❌ No X button to close
- ❌ Escape key disabled
- ❌ Outside click disabled
- ❌ No programmatic close option
- ✅ Must take action to proceed

### 📁 **Files Modified**
- `LicenseExpiryPopup.tsx` - Added custom DialogContent without close button
- `LicenseExpiryManager.tsx` - Empty onClose function
- `PLAN_ACCESS_CONTROL_README.md` - Updated documentation

### 🧪 **Testing**
To test the non-dismissible popup:
1. Login with `expiring-today@test.com` (expires today)
2. Verify popup appears and cannot be closed by:
   - Clicking X button (should not exist)
   - Pressing Escape key
   - Clicking outside the popup
   - Any other method

### 🎉 **Result**
Users on their expiry day will see a mandatory popup that forces them to either renew their license or extend it. There's no way to bypass this popup and continue using the application without addressing the license expiry issue.

This ensures 100% compliance with license renewal requirements!
